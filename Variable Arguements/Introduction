In Variable arguements we can provide more than one arguements in a function.
There is no need to create same methods or function for the same repeatiting task
which performs the same operation but when we increase the arguements which is greater than
the class methods parameter capacity we create the same method for the same tast but with
more parameters.
In this var args we will only create one Method/Function which will accept the every arguements for the same operation which
we want to perform.

Lets see a example and create the demonstration of the var args.
