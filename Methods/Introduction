When we have to perform same operation again and again we use Methods.
We create the method in the class and pass parameters in it.
When we perform some task in our main method we call the class method in the main method.
We pass the value after the calling the class method in the main method.
Then those value gets passed in the class method Parametetrs. Basically it creates the copy of the value
of the main method in the class method.
Class methods performs the operation which we created on in it and returns the value in the main method.
When we run the program we get the output which we required.

In a Summarize form we can say that we create a Function/Method in the class and we make cases that what the class method should
perform when it get called in the main method. This helps to maintain our main method due to the less lines of codes it becomes 
more understandable and readable. All the activities are going in class method and it returns  the value in the main method.

*Note* :- Java only support pass by value.
